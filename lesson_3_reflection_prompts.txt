When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when I want to fix a bug where I also needed to work on more than one computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    we want to commit as regularly as possible so that if we are stuck suddenaly with a bug it helps to recover.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    
    clone is simply having a copy of the repository into our local
    fork is cloning repository into our github 
    brach is an experimental changes in the same repository in our local machine

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    many benefits like we can  merge, add, view the changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    without git or github, I am not sure but i this case we need to directly communicate and share file through disks and all this would be made easy with git and github. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

     the main purpose is if you want others to review your changes before making it part of the master branch, or if you 
think it is likely that others could commit conflicting changes to master before you are able to commit your changes.
